(Verse 1)
Frosty, the snowman,
With a carrot for a nose,
Two eyes made of coal,
And a smile that always glows.

(Chorus)
Oh, snowman, snowman,
Bring us joy and cheer,
With your frosty body,
And your icy cheer.

(Verse 2)
He wears a hat and scarf,
And a broom for his hand,
He waves to all the kids,
In a winter wonderland.

(Chorus)
Oh, snowman, snowman,
Bring us joy and cheer,
With your frosty body,
And your icy cheer.

(Bridge)
We build him every year,
When the snow starts to fall,
He fills our hearts with joy,
And makes us feel so small.

(Chorus)
Oh, snowman, snowman,
Bring us joy and cheer,
With your frosty body,
And your icy cheer.

(Outro)
Frosty the snowman,
We love you so,
You make our winters bright,
With your icy glow.
